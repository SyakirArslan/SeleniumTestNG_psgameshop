# Selenium TestNG

This Test Automation is created using Java + Selenium Web Driver + TestNG. Which can be used across different web based applications. 
In this approach, the endeavor is to build a lot of applications independent reusable components so that they can directly used for 
another web application without spending any extra effort.
